What?
====

Ponder is a simple, source-code-only thing, that can help doing common expression reflection tasks in C#.

How?
====

# Put Ponder.cs in a lib folder in your project.
# In your project, go to the "Add existing item..." menu, and MARK Ponder.cs (don't SELECT it just yet...)
# Click that funny little arrow next to the "Add" button
# Select "Add As Link"

and BAM! - your project should now _reference_ Ponder.cs, thus allowing it to reside in your `lib` folder and be updated like you update all of your other dependencies.
